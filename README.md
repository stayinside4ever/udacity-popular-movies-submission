# Popular Movies

This is my submission for the Udacity Android Nanodegree project _Popular Movies_.

## API Key

The key should be placed in the respective string in AppConstants.java. I have created a TODO item next to the String constant it's supposed to be put in.

## TMDb API

While this app uses the TMDb API, it is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.
